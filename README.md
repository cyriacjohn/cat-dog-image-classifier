Completed the code below to classify images of dogs and cats. Used Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)
```
cats_and_dogs
|__ train:
    |______ cats: [cat.0.jpg, cat.1.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.0.jpg, dog.1.jpg ...]
|__ validation:
    |______ cats: [cat.2000.jpg, cat.2001.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.2000.jpg, dog.2001.jpg ...]
|__ test: [1.jpg, 2.jpg ...]
